# Progress Log

Bead: bd-3ub
Started: 2026-02-15

## Codebase Patterns

- Admin layout frame and auth gating are centralized in `frontend/src/app/admin/layout.tsx`.
- Admin navigation behavior is centralized in `frontend/src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`.
- Global horizontal overflow is controlled in `frontend/src/app/globals.css`.

## 2026-02-15

- Claimed bead and moved status to in_progress.
- Created feature branch `feat/bd-3ub-admin-nav-full`.
- Converted PRD markdown to executable `prd.json` with 4 tasks.
- Implemented full-width admin shell in `frontend/src/app/admin/layout.tsx` by removing `max-w-7xl` and adding `data-testid="admin-layout-shell"`.
- Added admin layout regression coverage in `playwright/tests/rbac/admin-route-flow.spec.ts` (full-width + mobile reachability).
- Verified frontend gates (`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint:fix`, `npm run typecheck`) and admin route flow spec.
- Marked all PRD tasks as passed in `prd.json`.
