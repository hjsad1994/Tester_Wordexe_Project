## Codebase Patterns

- Page layout: `<div min-h-screen>` + Header + main + Footer
- Form validation: manual `validate()` with `errors` state object (see checkout page)
- Password toggle: EyeIcon/EyeOffIcon (see profile page)
- Context pattern: createContext + Provider + useContext hook (see CartContext)
- Icons: custom SVG components with `size` prop
- Header actions: rounded-full, hover:text-pink-500
- Theme: pink pastel CSS variables (--pink-50 through --pink-600)
- All UI text in Vietnamese
