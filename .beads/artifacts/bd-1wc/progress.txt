## 2026-02-15 - /ship execution

- Updated plan/prd scope to remove Playwright verification per user request.
- Backend: added Cloudinary config + multer upload middleware + `POST /api/products/:id/images` route/controller/service/repo integration.
- Backend: added deterministic `npm run seed` workflow creating categories/products and attempting Cloudinary URL uploads.
- Frontend: migrated homepage featured products + categories + `/products` page to API-driven data.
- Frontend: updated `ProductCard` to render `imageUrl` via `next/image` with illustration fallback.
- Verification run: frontend typecheck/lint/build pass; backend lint pass; backend seed idempotent pass.
- Blocker observed: Cloudinary credentials missing in local env (`Must supply api_key`) so seeded products currently have empty `images` arrays.

## 2026-02-15 - post-review fixes

- Improved seed idempotency: existing products with empty `images` now attempt Cloudinary backfill on subsequent seed runs.
- Fixed products page sorting: `Mới nhất` no longer reverses backend newest-first ordering.

## 2026-02-15 - Cloudinary backfill run

- After user updated `.env`, re-ran `npm run seed` to upload missing product images.
- Replaced 2 broken Unsplash source URLs in `backend/src/seed.js` with valid baby-related Pexels URLs.
- Backfill completed and all seeded products now have at least one Cloudinary image URL.
