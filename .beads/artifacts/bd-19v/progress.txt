# Progress Log

Bead: bd-19v
Started: 2026-02-16

## Codebase Patterns

- Frontend profile currently uses local mock state in `frontend/src/app/profile/page.tsx`.
- Authenticated user bootstrap uses `/api/auth/me` in `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`.
- Cloudinary upload implementation pattern exists in backend product service.

## Session Log

- `/start` initialized bead, branch, and task artifacts (`prd.json`, `progress.txt`).
- Implemented backend profile API (`GET/PATCH /api/users/me`) and avatar upload (`POST /api/users/me/avatar`) with MongoDB persistence + Cloudinary upload.
- Integrated `frontend/src/app/profile/page.tsx` with DB-backed profile loading/updating and avatar upload via API.
- Added Playwright specs for profile and avatar flows, but user requested not to run Playwright as final verification for `/ship`.
