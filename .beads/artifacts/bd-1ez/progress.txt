## Codebase Patterns

- AuthContext provides useAuth() hook with user.name, user.phone, user.address
- Checkout form uses plain useState<CheckoutFormData> — no form library
- Order model has customerInfo sub-document with province/district/ward/address
- Order service validates and normalizes customerInfo fields
- Admin panel shows order listing with customer name, phone, total, status
