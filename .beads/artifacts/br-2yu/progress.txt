## Codebase Patterns

- Multi-upload exists in reviews: `upload.array('images', 3)` + `ImageUploadPreview` component
- Backend: reviewService.js loops files → Cloudinary upload with rollback on failure
- Frontend validation: MIME check (jpeg/png/webp/gif), 5MB max per file
- UI locale: Vietnamese — all user-facing strings must be in Vietnamese
- Product model already supports `images: [String]` array in MongoDB
- Repository already has `addImage()` using `$push` — need matching `removeImage()` with `$pull`
